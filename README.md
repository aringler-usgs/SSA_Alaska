# SSA_Alaska
Code for the portions of Adam Ringler's contribution to the SSA Alaska instrumentation workshop. 

[Metadata_Response_and_Stuff](https://github.com/aringler-usgs/SSA_Alaska/blob/main/Metadata_Response_and_Stuff.ipynb) is the main notebook that discusses getting data and plotting it in common units.

[Rotation](https://github.com/aringler-usgs/SSA_Alaska/blob/main/Rotation.ipynb) is a simple notebook discussing how to rotate data into ZNE and RT directions.

Finally, [Accelerometer and Seismometer](https://github.com/aringler-usgs/SSA_Alaska/blob/main/Accelerometer%20and%20Seismometer.ipynb) shows how to compare accelerometer data and velocity sensor data in common units.

These notebooks roughly follow the papers: [Ringler and Bastien (2020)](https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/ssa/srl/article/91/2A/1074/580612/A-Brief-Introduction-to-Seismic-Instrumentation).


Thanks to [Will Yeck](https://github.com/wyeck-usgs) and Chanel Deane for comments and suggestions.
