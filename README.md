# SSA_Alaska
Code for the portions of Adam Ringler's contribution to the SSA Alaska instrumentation workshop. 

Thanks to [Will Yeck](https://github.com/wyeck-usgs) and Chanel Deane for comments and suggestions.

Metadata_Response_and_Stuff is the main notebook that discusses getting data and plotting it in common units.

Rotation is a simple notebook discussing how to rotate data into ZNE and RT directions.

Finally, Accelerometer and Seismometer shows how to compare accelerometer data and velocity sensor data in common units.
